### Note:
Still not done, there're still many requirements that were not met. Will try to update this project ASAP.

## Make a virtual environment first
The python version must be 3.11 to be compatible with the mediapipe
```sh
python -m venv myvenv
```

## Activate it
```sh
.\myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install the requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the python file
```sh
python RPS.py
```
